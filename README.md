# Project-Echo

In a pitch-black room you must work out where the enemy is from the sounds they make (shown by the white markers), then fire your one-and-only shot at them. Deduce their position before they attack you!

Controls:

Move: WSAD

Shoot: LMB

Good luck and have fun!

License: I haven't attached one yet as it's unlikely anyone will ever see this but please ask for permmission for anything to do with the game, thankyou!
